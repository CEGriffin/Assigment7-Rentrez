URGETNT - DNA SEQUENCING RESULTS OF PATIENT B3854723 - URGENT

Dear clinician,

I was the research scientist assigened to the blood samples you sent in of patient B3854723. As is regular procedure, I filtered out the human DNA and sequenced the non-human DNA. One sequence caught my eye:

> Human isolate, unknown sequence
GCCTGATGGAGGGGGATAACTACTGGAAACGGTAGCTAATACCGCATGAC
CTCGCAAGAGCAAAGTGGGGGACCTTAGGGCCTCACGCCATCGGATGAAC
CCAGATGGGATTAGCTAGTAGGTGGGGTAATGGCTCACCTAGGCGACGAT
CCCTAGCTGGTCTGAGAGGATGACCAGCCACACTGGAACTGAGACACGGT
CCAGACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGTGGGGAATATTGCACAATGGGCGCAA

This DNA belongs to the bacterium Yersinia pestis strain 46514, which as you may know cause the bubonic plague, aka the Black Death. This is a serious contagious disease (the black death was responsible for the death of over 1/3 of Europe in the late middle ages) and it is a matter of great import that you take the proper steps immediately. I have included the link to the ![Canadian government website on the plague](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/plague/health-professionals-plague.html) for your information. I have also embedded in this report the images of the common symptoms of this disease so that you migh better diagnose your patient and watch for further spread.

I have included the reproducable code I used to come to this conclusion under this message, should you wish to confirm my results.

Load Library (make sure to install this package first)
```{r, echo=T, , results="hide"}
library(BiocManager)
```

Name DNA sequence
```{r}
seq<-"GCCTGATGGAGGGGGATAACTACTGGAAACGGTAGCTAATACCGCATGACCTCGCAAGAGCAAAGTGGGGGACCTTAGGGCCTCACGCCATCGGATGAACCCAGATGGGATTAGCTAGTAGGTGGGGTAATGGCTCACCTAGGCGACGATCCCTAGCTGGTCTGAGAGGATGACCAGCCACACTGGAACTGAGACACGGTCCAGACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGTGGGGAATATTGCACAATGGGCGCAA"
```

This line of code uploads the DNA sequence to the BLAST infterface, where it is then compared to several millions to billions of known DNA sequences.
```{r, echo=T, results="hide"}
seq_Blast_df<-blastSequences(paste(seq), as='data.frame', timeout=240)
```

Interpret results: the output of this code shows the matches between our DNA and the known DNA from the database
```{r}
seq_Blast_df
```
The most important rows are these:
Hit_def is the name of the match of our sequence. In this case, all of our matches are for yersinia pestis, just different strains.
Hsp_score represents the strength of the match: the higher the score, the better the match. All of our scores are 500, which means a very strong match.
Hsp_evalue is another way to measure the strength of the match, but this time a better match is a lower number. These numbers are increadibly small, also indicating a very strong match.
